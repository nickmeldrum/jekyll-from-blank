## pre-requisites

 * Ruby (to run jekyll and gem install the dependencies)
 * Git client (to push updates to a github repo)

## Installation

Run `. script/init` to setup shell to easily run script commands.

## Commands

Note: to run any commands in a shell, you must run the `. script/init` command first to setup the shell correctly.

To run the jekyll site locally run the `local:run` command.

## Redirects and canonical urls

Jekyll outputs files with .html on the end, and we don't like that - so we have a lambda converting the following urls:

/blog => /blog.html
/cv => /cv.html
/ => /index.html
/page/2 => /page/2/index.html
/blog/beerware => /blog/beerware.html

the 404 page is found at `/404.html` in S3

### Before go live:

 * rewrite cv page content for my new profile

### Test:

 * disqus commenting
 * canonical is right in live - especially trailing slashes on /blog and /page/2 etc.
 * ga integration
 * 404's (on missing pages + /blog)
 * canonicals (e.g. trailing slashes, index.html versions)
 * check all old posts - missing imgs, broken tags etc.
 * check responsive width for all old posts is working
 * check (webmaster tools?) that all old urls with juice are still in same place

### After go live:

 * look at progressively upgrading to nicer downloadable font (without compromising initial render times)
 * add a booklist?
 * add a project list?
 * get twitter plugin in
 * get proper color scheme - base link colors/ other site colors/ favicon and brand logo on them
 * older/newer, next/prev - are they in the right direction? (check medium?)
 * add github etc. flair
 * fix responsive width for svg in decorator post
 * get a better li style
 * get proper quotes in text
 * add "share" links at bottom of post page?
 * get all the weird head attributes we need in nowadays
 * add tests using html proofer
 * get search in?
 * get my header image in and parallax scrolling (css only)
 * create a dark theme switch
 * look at gradual font improvement on load (currently waits for css/ fonts to download before rendering)

 * look at writing automation scripts for the platform setup:
   * s3 bucket create
   * cloudfront create and set origin to s3, behaviours for 404, 403
   * set access identity for cf to write to and read from s3
   * lambda edge triggered on cd origin request to rewrite index-html
   * setup execution roles for lambda edge trigger
   * setup travis to auto deploy
