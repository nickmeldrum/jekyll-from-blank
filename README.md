## pre-requisites

 * Ruby (to run jekyll and gem install the dependencies)
 * Git client (to push updates to a github repo)

## Installation

Run `. script/init` to setup shell to easily run script commands.

## Commands

Note: to run any commands in a shell, you must run the `. script/init` command first to setup the shell correctly.

To run the jekyll site locally run the `local:run` command.
